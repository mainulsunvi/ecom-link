# Getting Started

Ecom-Link connects your WooCommerce store to Framer and keeps your product data in Framer CMS collections. This page walks you through the first steps: opening the plugin, connecting your store, and checking that the connection is healthy.

## What You Need Before Starting

- The web address of your WooCommerce store, such as `https://store.example.com`. The address must use HTTPS.
- A pair of REST API keys from WooCommerce. Keys with read permission are enough to get started.
- The Framer project that will hold your products.

If you do not have API keys yet, the [Connections](./Connections.md) page shows exactly where to generate them in WooCommerce.

## Step 1: Open The Plugin

Open your Framer project and select Ecom-Link from the plugins menu. The plugin window will open on the right side of the canvas.

## Step 2: Connect Your Store

Select **Connect store**. A form will appear asking for your store address, your consumer key, and your consumer secret. Fill in the three fields and select **Connect store** again. The plugin will contact your store, check the keys, and save the connection.

If anything is wrong, a clear message will tell you what to fix. The [Connections](./Connections.md) page explains every message, including the browser restriction some stores hit on the first try.

## Step 3: Check The Connection

After connecting, your dashboard will show the store with a status label:

- **Connected** means the keys work and the store answered.
- **Connection failed** means the last check did not pass. Select **Revalidate** to try again after fixing the cause.
- **Not checked yet** means no check has run.

Your keys will always appear masked, like `ck_••••1234`. That is normal and keeps your secrets off the screen.

## What Comes Next

Once your store is connected, product syncing is the next step. The import and sync controls are being finished and will appear in the plugin window in an upcoming update, so your connected store is ready for them the moment they arrive.
